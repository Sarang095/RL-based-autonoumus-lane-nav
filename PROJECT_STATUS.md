## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### **Fix #5: Environment Observation Dimensionality Error**
**Problem**: `ValueError: Output array has wrong dimensionality` during environment reset
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between highway-env's internal frame stacking and external FrameStackObservation wrapper
**Solution**: 
- Removed redundant `VisionObservationWrapper` class
- Modified `create_environment()` to pass full config directly to `gym.make()`
- Leveraged highway-env's internal `GrayscaleObservation` frame stacking capability
- Eliminated external `FrameStackObservation` wrapper to prevent conflicts
- Added missing 'weights' parameter to all environment configurations

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Environment now properly creates (4, 84, 84) stacked visual observations

### Previous Fixes
- **Fix #1**: FrameStack → FrameStackObservation import correction
